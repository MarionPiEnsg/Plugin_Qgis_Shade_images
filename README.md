Go in QGIS and search "shade" plugin in the plugins manager, check it. Then you can find it in your toolbar.

This plugin is user friendly, if you have some questions contact me or go to the GDAL documentation "DEMProcessing" : http://gdal.org/python/osgeo.gdal-module.html#DEMProcessingOptions

The python code of this plugin is in english but the interface is in french.
